# Per-Container-Extension-control

**Note: this repo has been archived as Firefox extensions need to specify whether or not to allow other extensionsto access them.** Not sure if this can be specified as a discrete or list or is it just a general setting. 

Iirc I needed this for enhanced privacy when using Web Scrobbler (to protect myself against Paramount, not WS's maintainer of course).

The whole thing should be implemented by Mozilla themselves, but unfortunately containers, while being an awesome tool for improving own privacy, seem to be a bit overlooked feature, so my suggestion to implement something similar was duly ignored.

If you, however, do stumble upon this repo and decide that this thing might be somehow doable, then go ahead and drop me a line:
